# Properties active for ALL profiles:
---
# This 'name' of our application is important 
# as the config server typically has to serve up properties for many applications:
spring:
  application:
    name: server-config-data			# name must be same like .yml/.properties file name
  
  profiles:
    active: northamerica					# will refer server-config-data-northamerica.yml file
    
  cloud:
    config:
      uri: http://localhost:8001		# Where should we call the config server at?
    
server:
  port: 8002							# What port should we expose for our web interface


# Uncomment these lines to activate "northamerica" as the active profile.
# Ordinarily we would not activate a profile from within a property file, but this is just a demo:
#---
#spring:
#  profiles:
#    active: northamerica
